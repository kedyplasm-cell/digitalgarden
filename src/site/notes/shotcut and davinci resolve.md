i feel like shoutcut is a more relatively unknown editor, most people on youtube either talk about "Davinci resolve is better that premiere pro!" and it absolutely is! free software is great and even if it is not open source, i still like it .  shotcut is the exact same as Davinci resolve, some might disagree, but i believe it is , mostly because of the similar things you can do with them (AND I USE SHOTCUT NOT BECAUSE I CANT INSTAL DAVINCI RESOLVE ON LINUX). i personaly use shoutcut for editing things, my recent video for school was editiedin shotcut and people loved it . i mean you could buy premiere pro and get , a little more features that davinci or shoutcut, but i mean , you have to have some knowledge about editing first.

if you are a complete begginer to editing and you just want the basics, check out shotcut, its on all platforms and it is a solid editor.
