ok so i really want to learn python beacause then i can code WHATEVER I WANT , its insane. plus im learning it because the game engine i use, godot, has a similar syntax to python so im learning that . also then i could make [[games i would try to make if i had the skill\|games i would try to make if i had the skill]] which is really really cool, also i try to explain videos in 3d too but its been getting harder so i might be switching to manim, who knows, or maybe i will do a mix of the 2.
